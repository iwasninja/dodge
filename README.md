### The dodgeDude game
_______

*dodge* is a sample game developed using [Phaser.js](http://phaser.io/)
To run/develop it locally clone this repository on your desktop and then inside repository's folder run
```bash
npm install
```
to download anything necessary. Run 
```bash
grunt
```
to start grunt.
Grunt will compile the assets, run a server, point your browser to `localhost:9000` (where the game will be running) and refresh the page when you save any changes on your code.
You are now ready to play and develop. Enjoy!
